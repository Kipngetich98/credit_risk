# credit_risk
The most pressing questions for banks are how efficiently can we guage the risk profile of our customers and how can we use this information to decide on the required liquidity while still maintaining our regulatory obligations.

With the constantly changing customer portfolio and the ever increasing customer base a more robust non-hardcoded approach is neccessary to achieve these antagonistic goals.

Thus comes the idea of using machine learning to develop a behavioural scorecard to pull data from both internal sources, customer transactions and their demographic data, to predict the probability of default.

In this notebook we are going to explore the data cleaning and transformation as well as machine learing modelling in predicting probability of default. We will then use these results to develop a credit rating.

Further we will explore the callibration and validation of the developed model to assess compliance with industry benchmarks and regulatory requirements.

We will eplore the following concepts in the notebook

Data cleaning - Struucturing the data for modelling
What to do with missing values
How to deal with class imbalance and the implications.
How to choose the most appropriate modelling technique based on the reporting expectations
